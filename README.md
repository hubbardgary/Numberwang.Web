What is this?
=============
Numberwang is a clone of the popular [Threes](http://asherv.com/threes/) and [2048](https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) games, and some of their many spin-offs.

I used this as a vehicle to help me learn AngularJS and other programming frameworks. This repo also contains a plain jQuery version, and a C#/WPF version is available [elsewhere](https://github.com/hubbardgary/NumberWang).

Play it [here](http://hubbardgary.github.io/Numberwang.Web/#/menu)!

Local Installation
==================
Clone this repo, then navigate to the AngularJS directory and run the following:

npm install  
npm start

You will then be able to access it from your browser at [http://localhost:8080/app/index.html](http://localhost:8080/app/index.html).
